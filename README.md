There are 3 files in here.
One is the code just for the ADXL345 Accelerometer which converts the acceleration in G's to velocity in m/s in the X,Y, and Z directions.
One is the code for the FSR which takes input from 4 different FSR sensors and outputs the zone or sensor with the highest force.
The last one is a bluetooth code that sends the velocity and zone to a terminal or website.
